# Hybrid-Image
Blurring level affect our perception of the results because high frequencies dominate when the object is close to us, while lower frequencies dominate when it is further away. In order to demonstrate the hybrid images by applying a Gaussian blur to an image  to Figure 1, generate a low-pass filtered equivalent. Figure 2, generate the high-pass filtered
equivalent. Adding the high and low frequencies together Figure 3, shows the hybrid images  which are changing their interpretation depending on their viewing distance.
