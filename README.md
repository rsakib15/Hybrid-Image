# Hybrid-Image
Blurring level affect our perception of the results because high frequencies dominate when the object is close to us, while lower frequencies dominate when it is further away.
In order to demonstrate the hybrid images by applying a Gaussian blur to an image to generate a low-pass filtered equivalent.

Then, Generate the high-pass filtered equivalent.

Adding the high and low frequencies together shows the hybrid images  which are changing their interpretation depending on their viewing distance.
